Twitter Tweets Data Analysis
This project involves the analysis of Twitter tweet data using Python. The primary goals are to preprocess the data, perform sentiment analysis, and visualize sentiment trends over time.

Project Overview
The dataset used in this project is a collection of tweets with their timestamps. The analysis includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning:

Reading the dataset from a CSV file.
Removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and stop words.
Tokenizing and lemmatizing the text data.
Sentiment Analysis:

Utilizing the VADER Sentiment Analysis tool to determine the sentiment of each tweet.
Calculating a sentiment score for each tweet, ranging from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).
Data Visualization:

Plotting the average sentiment score over time to visualize trends in tweet sentiments.
Files in the Repository
tweets.csv: The dataset containing tweet text and their timestamps.
analysis.py: The main Python script containing code for data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization.
requirements.txt: A list of all dependencies required to run the code.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

pandas
nltk
vaderSentiment
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preprocessing
The following steps are performed to clean and prepare the data for analysis:

Conversion to lowercase: Ensures uniformity of the text.
Removal of URLs, mentions, and hashtags: Excludes unnecessary data.
Punctuation and number removal: Keeps only words for analysis.
Stop word removal: Filters out common English words that do not contribute to sentiment.
Lemmatization: Reduces words to their base form.
Sentiment Analysis
The VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer is used to assign a sentiment score to each tweet. The compound score is used to indicate the overall sentiment:

Positive scores indicate positive sentiment.
Negative scores indicate negative sentiment.
Scores close to zero indicate neutral sentiment.
Visualization
The trend of sentiment scores over time is visualized using a line plot to understand how sentiments evolved over the dataset's timeline.

Running the Analysis
To execute the analysis, run the analysis.py script:

bash
Copy code
python analysis.py
This will output the cleaned data, sentiment scores, and a sentiment trend graph.
